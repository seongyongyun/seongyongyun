### Hey! I'm Seongyong Yun. 👋

I want to build software that is heavily involved in your lifestyle. While rapidly developing and launching dozens of indie games, I became interested in the IT market. An engineer at Google, one of the big tech companies, advised me not to limit myself to a small business called games, and I've been making more diverse software ever since. As an undergraduate, I majored in visual design and business administration. I also have an academic interest in early stage startups and entrepreneurship. I look at the industry from an engineering perspective, but I also try to have a design or financial perspective too.
